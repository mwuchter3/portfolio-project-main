# Portfolio Project

This repo contains the code for my portfolio project, created as part of the software 2 class at OSU.

The goal of this project was to design and implement a software component from scratch. I chose to create a Matrix component that supports basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot product, and cross product.

This project helped me better understand the full development process—not just writing code, but also working with files, organizing a project, setting up testing with JUnit, and using tools like VS Code and ChannelLog. I faced a lot of challenges, but I learned a lot along the way.

There’s way more to software development than just writing code. This project was hard at times, but it gave me real experience with the kind of work developers actually do. It was frustrating, but also rewarding once everything started working.
